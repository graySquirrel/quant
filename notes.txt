sharpe ratio, higher is better.  
S = E[ R - Rf]/sigma
  = E[ R - Rf]/sqrt(R - Rf)
Rf is reference return, but it is typically ignored.
metric = k * mean(daily_rets)/stdev(daily_rets)

k is sqrt(250) for daily returns 250 days in trading year
daily_rets = daily_val[i]/daily_val[i-1] - 1

What is the sharpe ratio for a fund that has 
mean(daily return) = 0.005 and 
standard deviation (daily) = 0.04, 
assume 250 trading days in the year.

 = sqrt(250) * .005/.04
 = 15.8114 * .005/.04 = 1.976

to make an order:
symbol, buy or sell, market or limit, numshares, price (if limit)
advice is to use limit orders
The spread is the gap between what people are willing to pay and lowest asking price

news affects stock prices
discount rate vs. dividends.
ways to value a company
value = assets + future value

future value = div * 1/(1-discount rate)
assets = total assets - intangible assets - liabilities
market says value is market cap = # shares * price

CAPM capital assets pricing model
most important factor in a stock price is 'what is the market doing'...
is is stock, i.e. stock i
ri(t) = betai * rm(t) + alphai
r is return, rm is market return, beta is scale factor for market return
alpha is residual
E[alpha] = 0
